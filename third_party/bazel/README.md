## Purpose

There is no official generated Go code for the Build Event Stream protobuf definition.
`download.sh` extracts the original protobuf definitions into this folder.
The `BUILD.bazel` defines Protobuf and Go targets
that specifies the original namespaces to try to make the code interoperable.
